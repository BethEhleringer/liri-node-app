# liri-node-app
LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data. LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.
## Directions
LIRI operates from the command line interface. Type the *action* and then the title of the work you want to look up.
* To look up a song, type _"spotify-this-song"_ and the name of the song.
* To look a a movie, type _"movie-this"_ and the name of the movie.
* To see where and when an artist's next concert is, type the _"concert-this"_ and the name of the artist.
* If the name of the artist or song or movie title is more than one word, use quotes.
* If you don't specify a song or movie title or an artist, LIRI will pick one for you.
* To look up a random song, movie and concert, type _"do-what-it-says"_.

## Bugs
* The substitute song is supposed to be _"The Sign"_ by Ace of Bass. This program will present more than one artist performing a song by this name. Some of the songs have profanity in the titles.
* The _"do-what-it-says"_ function is _supposed_ is listing a different movie than the one intended in the program.
